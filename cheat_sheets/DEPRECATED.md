# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

Cheat sheets have been moved to their respective skill directories.

## New Locations

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `cheat_sheets/gdb_cheatsheet.md` | `.agents/skills/pwn-exploits/references/gdb_cheatsheet.md` |
| `cheat_sheets/ettercap_usage.md` | `.agents/skills/ics-traffic/references/ettercap_usage.md` |
| `cheat_sheets/linux_commands.md` | `.agents/skills/misc-tools/references/linux_commands.md` |

## Finding References

All reference materials are now in skill-specific `references/` directories:

```
.agents/skills/
├── pwn-exploits/references/
├── ics-traffic/references/
├── misc-tools/references/
└── [other skills]/references/
```

## Documentation

See `.agents/skills/README.md` for the complete skills structure.
